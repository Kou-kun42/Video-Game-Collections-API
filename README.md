[Documentation Site](https://kou-kun42.github.io/Video-Game-Collections-API/)

[Public Deployment](https://video-game-collections-api.herokuapp.com/)

## Overview

In this API, you can create games and collections. You can create as many games and collections as you want. All games are shared and available to all users, however each user can only view their own collections. As someone who loves collecting games, I find myself needing an easy way to keep track of games I have or games I want to buy. Another great use is to use it as a backlog manager where you can have lists of games you want to one day play, or have a list of games you've already played. This API is simple but can be applied to many uses.

## Basic Functions

The features of this API are as follows:

- Sign up and login as an authenticated user
- Create new games to the database
- Create new collections to the database that the creator can access
- Add games to any of your collections
- Remove games from any of your collections
- Rename a game and edit its platform value
- Rename a collection
- Delete a collection
- View a game's details
- View all of the collections you have created
- View the games contained within a specific collection you have created

## Local Deployment

To deploy this locally, make sure you have Nodejs and npm installed on your system. Next, clone this repo and run `npm install` to download all dependencies that are needed. Next, create a `.env` in the root of the project folder and add the following information to it, filling in the placeholders respectively:

Finally, you can run the server with `npm start`.
